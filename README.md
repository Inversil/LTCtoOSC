# LTCtoOSC + Touch Designer
This is a Max 4 live plugin with a companion touchdesigner project that you can use to more reliably time synchronize GPU accelerated video in Ableton Live on Windows.

This is based on a Max for Live LTC decoder (https://github.com/ArtScienceLab/M4L_LTC_Reader), which itself is based on code provided by David Butler / The Impersonal Stereo (https://github.com/impsnldavid/imp.ltc/tree/develop)
